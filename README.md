# Personal-Projects
Projects that were personal, but not tutorial or worksheet oriented.

This will include probably a mix of projects. While my focus is specific, I prefer a generalization approach to understanding.
The more things I know the more I can connect between them to help me create innovative solutions to future problems (ideally.)

Jack of all trade, master of none; still better yet then a master of one.
